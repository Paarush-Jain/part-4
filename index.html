                <p class="text-muted text-left">Crown Melbourne (also referred to as Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex) is a casino and resort located on the south bank of the Yarra River, in Melbourne, Australia. Crown Casino is a unit of Crown Limited, and the first casino of the now-international Crown brand.

                    Initially having opened in 1994 on the north bank of the Yarra, Crown Melbourne relocated and re–opened on the south bank of the Yarra, in 1997. It remains one of the central features of the Southbank precinct of the Melbourne central business district. The entire complex has a space of 510,000 m²—the equivalent to two city blocks—making it the largest casino complex in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the largest in the world. The complex also hosts four hotels, Crown Towers, Crown Promenade, and Crown Metropol, with a fourth hotel approved for construction which is expected to commence in 2018.

                    The casino is accessible by tram routes 12, 58, 96, 109 which all pass near Southern Cross railway station and the Melbourne City Centre.

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium is a Southern Ocean and Antarctic aquarium in central Melbourne, Australia. It is located on the banks of the Yarra River beside and under the Flinders Street Viaduct and the King Street Bridge. The attraction is a Sea Life Centre owned by Merlin Entertainments. The current building was built between February 1998 and December 1999,[2] the building was designed by Peddle Thorp architects to resemble a ship moored to the river, and opened in January 2000.[3] The depth of the building however was designed not to be imposing at street level, and extends 7 metres (23 ft) below the surface. At its centre is a world first 2,200,000-litre (580,000 US gal) 'oceanarium in the round' where the spectators become the spectacle to the marine life swimming around them.[4][5]

                    Soon after opening, the building had a legionnaires disease outbreak that resulted in 2 deaths and another 60 people being affected. Those affected had visited the aquarium between 11 and 27 April 2000. A damages action was brought in May 2000, ending in February 2004.[6]

                    On 28 November 2008 Melbourne Aquarium officially opened after a significant expansion, also designed by Peddle Thorp, and now extends from the Yarra River to Flinders Street. A new entrance was built on the corner of Flinders and King Streets. The expansion features exhibits with king penguins and gentoo penguins, as well as many Antarctic fish, a first for Australia. The exhibits also feature real ice and snow to simulate Antarctic conditions, and take visitors on an expedition to Antarctica.[7] The penguins were sourced from Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World in New Zealand.

                    In April 2013, Melbourne Aquarium's owners, Merlin Entertainments, announced that they would be spending $8 million on the refurbishment of the facilities. As part of the process, the aquarium will be rebranded as a Sea Life Centre and relaunched in September 2013.[8]

                    The current Aquarium succeeded an earlier site in the Eastern annex of the Royal Exhibition Building, which burned down in 1953.

                <p>The shaming of “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” will continue apace — or better still, be forgotten entirely — in the wake of “Captain America: Civil War,” a decisively superior hero-vs.-hero extravaganza that also ranks as the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Very much an “Avengers” movie in scope and ambition if not title (the conspicuous absence of Thor and Hulk notwithstanding), this chronicle of an epic clash between two equally noble factions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, proves as remarkable for its dramatic coherence and thematic unity as for its dizzyingly inventive action sequences; viewers who have grown weary of seeing cities blow up ad nauseam will scarcely believe their luck at the relative restraint and ingenuity on display. Buoyed by hearty critical support, 3D ticket premiums and enormous fan-ticipation, Disney’s May 6 release should have little trouble outperforming 2014’s “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”</p>

                <p>Shorn of his blonde locks, his mighty hammer, and his sense of humor, Hemsworth plays a superhero mercenary for hire named Tyler Rake. With a name like that, you can bet your last money that at some point during the film’s 116-minute runtime, Tyler will take a baddie out with the garden instrument that bears his name. It’s a gnarly kill, right through the eyes of one of the hundreds of expendable extras. Such grotesquerie signifies just how hard the R-rating will be on this Netflix release; heads are treated poorly, broken bones protrude and bodies are flung from buildings and riddled with bullets. Not that I’m complaining, mind you, considering how welcome it is that stunt coordinator-turned-director Sam Hargrove frames the carnage in well-edited, easy-to-follow chunks. I’m just letting you know what you’re in for here.</p>

                <p>Vroom! Bwoosh! Flex! Vin Diesel! John Cena! At long last, it's Fast and Furious 9. Cars! Magnets! Explosions! None of it matters! Caaaars!

                    Originally planned for May last year, Fast and Furious 9 (formerly known as F9) is out now. Back in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic F9 was one of the first blockbusters to bump its release date, and now lands just as theaters reopen in the US and UK. That means F9 isn't streaming on HBO Max or any other streaming service, so obviously you should follow local guidelines and attend any venue only if you feel safe and comfortable. It's only a movie. But however and whenever you see Fast and Furious 9, rest assured that what you're going to see is a movie. Like, possibly the movie-est movie that ever movied. </p>

                    The most common causes of bushfires in Australia include lighting strikes, trees falling on powerlines, arsonists, unintentional kindling of surrounding foliage during agricultural land clearing, dropped matches, cigarettes, sparks caused by power tools, farm machinery and controlled backburning escaping.

                    Eucalypt trees are synonymous with the Australian bushland and are what most Australians identify with when they hear the words "bushfire". The eucalyptus leaves contain highly flammable oils that have the ability to burn rapidly and extremely well in a fire.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">More than half of Australia's population is now living in states that don't expect to return to being coronavirus-free before vaccination levels dramatically improve, if at all.

                    The Victorian government yesterday conceded its outbreak of the Delta variant is highly unlikely to be beaten back to zero, meaning its long lockdown is set to stretch well into spring.

                    It's the second state, after New South Wales, to determine that even though cases are still growing, it has nothing left to throw at the Delta variant.

                    Delta has proven to be a formidable foe, even against the tools that worked to suppress outbreaks across the country last year, including Melbourne's devastating second wave.

                    On a day where case numbers spiked into the triple digits, Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews said the health advice had "fundamentally changed".</p>
